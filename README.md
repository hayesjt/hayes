## Project Architecture:

Below is a diagram showing the pages you can find on Haylee Site. I did not want this site to be complex - I wanted it to be easy for those that have reached out to me or those reviewing my site due to job oppurtunities to find what they were looking for easily. I did not include my past design work, blog, or social media on this site - if you are intrested in those please feel free to connect but I am no longer persuing design oppurtunties.
