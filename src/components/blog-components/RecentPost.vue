        The short answer is not really but here is my long answer as to why.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended 9 months of bootcamp classes. For the first 6 months I
        attended University of Minnesota’s Full Stack Bootcamp (Trimble makes
        the content) where I learned the MERN stack. The last 3 months I went to
        Hackbright Academy which is based out of San Francisco. There I learned
        how to be a full stack developer in Python. Though I have 9 months of
        experience I really learned the same basic concepts twice, just in
        separate languages. Though going through it twice was helpful in some
        respects, it did not really excel me beyond the level I was at after the
        first bootcamp and it did not get me up to speed with those that get a
        4-year degree in computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The level of speed that comes with a bootcamp really makes grasping
        concepts and keeping them in your knowledge later extremely hard. I
        remember taking one day in each bootcamp to cover different aspects of
        testing within applications – which is a huge part of being a software
        engineer and goes beyond a few hours of lecture. Not only could they not
        cover important topics such as the types of testing, test driven
        development, and edge cases but they also don’t explain that you’re
        using a package to test. I remember getting to my first day at Target
        unable to grasp what the heck ‘Spock’ (testing framework for Groovy) was
        and why we need to use it. I also could not open our applications and
        just understand the core differences between our unit, functional, and
        integration tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every topic covered in the bootcamps felt very much like the above
        example – I could remember us talking about it, but I could remember
        very little information and once I fully understood it by reading more,
        learning, and leaning on my Target mentors I realized they taught us how
        to do it in one coding language, with one package, and did not explain
        the more general big picture ideas that I needed to be a true software
        engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to attend these
        bootcamps and to get into Target as an Emerging Engineer I feel like I
        needed more training and I had so much to learn just to catch up with
        someone coming out of a 4-year computer science degree. I strongly
        encourage more companies to hire those out of a nontraditional education
        and give them the opportunity to show they have the strength and
        determination to learn all of this while starting a new job.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are someone looking to go into a bootcamp I would highly
        recommend taking some courses that offer general computer science and
        software engineering topics before attending. I share lots of these topics and links on my
        New Developer Resources page!
